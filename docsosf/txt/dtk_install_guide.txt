FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions about DECtalk Software
Q: What is DECtalk Software?
A: DECtalk Software is software that converts ASCII text into speech without the use of special or proprietary hardware.
Q: What hardware does it support? Does it work or require a DECtalk hardware device?
A: Although DECtalk Software does not need any specialized hardware (specialized hardware is defined as boards and devices released over the years with other DECtalk products) for the text-to-speech conversion process, you must have a sound card installed or built into your computer.
Q:  Who is DECtalk Software for?
A:  DECtalk Software is for users and developers.
For users, there are the Dtsample (Windows only) and Speak graphical applets, the Say command-line applet, and the User Dictionary Build Tool.  These provide a runtime environment in which users can speak text files directly using DECtalk applications or, in the Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 environment, through other applications using a Text-to-Speech server. 
For developers, DECtalk additionally provides an API and sample source code that can be used to incorporate text-to-speech synthesis into Windows, Linux, or Tru64 UNIX applications. 
Q: How long does it take DECtalk Software to start speaking?
A: DECtalk Software is optimized for quick startup. However, speaking start time is hardware (processor type) and software (operating system) dependent.
Q: Can DECtalk Software be used in a telephony environment. 
A: Yes, DECtalk Software supports 8-bit mu-law synthesis and a multi-instance environment with the proper licenses.
Q: Can I create my own DECtalk voice?
A: Yes! In addition to the nine predefined voices, you can create a customized voice of your own. See Chapter 5 in the DECtalk Software Reference Guide.
Q: What is the difference between the DECtalk Software Development Kit (SDK) and other DECtalk products?
A: The DECtalk family of products is listed in the following table.

Chapter 1 -
Installing DECtalk Software
for Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000
This chapter provides information you need to install the DECtalk Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 on a host computer system.
Specific topics include:
* Preparing for installation
* Installing DECtalk Software
* Installing SAPI Version 5 support (optional)
* Modifying, repairing, or removing the current installation
* Displaying documentation
* Solving installation problems
The DECtalk Software documentation is provided in PDF and other formats on the distribution CD-ROM. After a successful installation, DECtalk Software online help is accessible in the form of Windows Help. For more information, see Displaying Documentation.
Preparing for Installation 
DECtalk Software is installed from the installation media shipped with the product. The installation should take you no longer than five minutes to complete. You can launch the InstallShield Wizard for DECtalk Software automatically, by inserting the installation CD-ROM, or manually, by using Windows Explorer or the Windows Run or Command Prompt facilities.
Before installing DECtalk Software:
* Make sure that all prerequisite hardware and software components are installed on your system.
* If another version of DECtalk Software is already installed, close any running DECtalk applications and uninstall the existing DECtalk Software.
During DECtalk Software installation, the InstallShield Wizard will display a License Agreement window, which explains the terms of the DECtalk Software license agreement, and a Readme window, which provides the latest information about the DECtalk Software product. Please read the complete contents of both windows carefully and make sure that you understand them before you continue.
Hardware Requirements
DECtalk Software for Windows requires an Intel-based Windows host system with adequate disk space for installation and a standard audio sound card.
DECtalk Software performance is dependent on your system having enough computational power to perform all the computations involved in text-to-speech conversion. See the release notes for a list of the latest supported systems.
Note
DECtalk Software performance can be affected in a heavily loaded multitasking environment where DECtalk Software could become starved for computational power and will not speak continuously. There might be pauses in output for any application running on such a system.
Audio Output Device 
Your system must be configured with an audio device and appropriate driver that support 8-bit or 16-bit data format at an 11.025 kHz sample rate. You can install DECtalk Software without an audio device present and capture .wav audio files; however, an audio device must be present to actually have DECtalk Software speak text.
Required Disk Space and Software
DECtalk Software for Windows requires:
* A minimum of 31 MB of disk space for a Full Installation; however, if you specify a Custom Installation to the InstallShield Wizard, you can monitor the disk space required and make adjustments (see Selecting Components for a Custom Installation)

Your system must be configured with an audio device and appropriate driver that support 8-bit or 16-bit data format at an 11.025 kHz sample rate. You can install DECtalk Software without an audio device present and capture .wav audio files; however, an audio device must be present to actually have DECtalk Software speak text.
Required Disk Space and Software
DECtalk Software for Linux requires:
* A minimum of 3 MB disk space for proper configuration and installation
* Red Hat Linux Version 5.0 or higher
* Kernel 2.0.34 or higher
* glibc V2.0 (libc6)
* GTK+ V1.2.7
Installing DECtalk Software
To install DECtalk Software for Linux:
1. Review DECtalk's list of target installation directories, locations.sh, and make any necessary modifications.
2. Run the DECtalk installation script, install.sh.
If a previous version of DECtalk Software exists on your system, the new installation overwrites it.
Reviewing the List of Target Installation Directories
Before starting the DECtalk Software for Linux installation, you should examine the list of target installation directories in the file locations.sh, found in the working installation directory.
If you would like DECtalk Software components installed to locations other than the defaults, modify the file to specify the pathnames you desire.
Normally, you will want to preserve the hierarchy of subdirectories that are defined relative to $BASE_DIR in locations.sh.
Running the Installation Script
To install, DECtalk Software for Linux, run the script install.sh, found in the working installation directory.
The installation script does the following:
1. Installs software libraries to the LIBS directory, as defined in locations.sh
2. Installs dictionary files to the DICTIONARIES directory, as defined in locations.sh
3. Installs bitmap files to the BITMAPS directory, as defined in locations.sh
4. Installs text sample programs to the TEXT_SAMPLE_PROGRAMS directory, as defined in locations.sh
5. Installs graphic sample programs to the GRAPHIC_SAMPLE_PROGRAMS directory, as defined in locations.sh
6. Installs HTML, PDF, and PS documentation to html, pdf, and ps subdirectories of the DOCUMENTATION directory, as defined in locations.sh
7. Installs reference pages to the MAN1 and MAN3 directories, as defined in locations.sh
8. Installs sample source files to the SAMPLE_SOURCE directory, as defined in locations.sh
9. Creates the file /etc/DECtalk.conf and writes information to the file to record installation locations and licensing information
10. Invokes the say utility to speak the following:
"DECtalk Vn.nn has been successfully installed."

When the DECtalk Software for Linux installation is complete, the script displays the following message:

If DECtalk just spoke, DECtalk was sucessfully installed.
If DECtalk did not speak, your sound device may not be functioning or
your path may not include the directory that DECtalk was installed to.
If you have installed rsynth, rsynth installs a say program of
its own.  That may be the program that just spoke.
Displaying Documentation
The DECtalk Software documentation is provided in PDF, Postscript, and HTML file formats on the distribution CD-ROM. You can display the files on your workstation using Adobe Acrobat Reader, a Postscript reader, or a browser application.
After a successful installation, DECtalk Software online help is accessible in two forms:
* Reference (man) pages - Invoke reference page help for DECtalk utilities (such as speak) and API functions from the Linux command line with the man command.  The reference pages are installed to the MAN1 and MAN3 directories, as defined in locations.sh.
* HTML Help - Start HTML Help by launching a web browser and loading the online help file defaultdectalk.html. The HTML Help files are installed to the html subdirectory of the DOCUMENTATION directory, as defined in locations.sh.
The DECtalk Software HTML Help files include guide and reference information about the following DECtalk features: 
* DECtalk Software applets
* Select DECtalk Software and then the DECtalk Applet Master Index.
* DECtalk Software API functions
* Select the Programmer's Guide and then the Introduction to the DECtalk Software API. 
* Select the Reference Guide and then DECtalk Software API Functions.
* DECtalk Software in-line commands
Select the Reference Guide and then one of the following:
* DECtalk Software In-Line Commands.
* Using In-Line Commands.
Additionally, PDF and Postscript files of the DECtalk Software manuals can be found in the pdf and ps subdirectories of the DOCUMENTATION directory, as defined in locations.sh.
Solving Installation Problems
If errors occur during the installation procedure, DECtalk Software returns an error message. Installation errors usually occur if any of the following conditions exist:
* The operating system version is incorrect.
* The prerequisite software and hardware components or version is missing or incorrect. 
* Insufficient disk space is available. 
* System files and parameters are not updated to reflect exact file locations and directory naming conventions. 
If you have problems while using DECtalk Software and you believe the error is caused by the application, do one of the following:
* If you purchased DECtalk Software from an Authorized Distributor or Reseller, contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller for support.
* If you purchased or licensed DECtalk Software directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).

Chapter 4 -
Installing DECtalk Software
for Tru64 UNIX
Chapter 4 
This chapter describes the tasks required to install DECtalk runtime and development software on Tru64 UNIX systems.  Topics include:
* Differences between the DECtalk Software Runtime Kit and the DECtalk Software Development Kit
* License requirements
* Installing DECtalk Runtime Software for Tru64 UNIX
* Installing DECtalk Development Software for Tru64 UNIX
What's the Difference Between the DECtalk Software Runtime Kit and the DECtalk Software Development Kit?
DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX is packaged as a runtime kit and a development kit. The runtime kit gives you access to the following DECtalk Software applications: say, speak, emacspeak, aclock, and windict.
To develop your own DECtalk Software applications, you must order the DECtalk Software Development Kit. The DECtalk Software Development Kit gives you access to the DECtalk Software API and sources for some sample application programs.
Note
You must install the runtime kit before you install the development kit.

License Requirements
You can run one copy of any DECtalk Software application at a time without needing an LMF license. A license is required to run more than one copy of the runtime kit or to use the DECtalk Software Development Kit. See Registering Your Software Licenses under each software kit for more information.
Installing DECtalk Runtime Software for Tru64 UNIX
This section describes the preinstallation, installation, and post-installation tasks required to install the DECtalk Software runtime kit on Tru64 UNIX systems.  Topics include:
* Preinstallation tasks
* Accessing the Release Notes
* Registering your software licenses
* Checking the software distribution kit
* Meeting hardware requirements
* Meeting software requirements
* Checking current disk space
* Increasing disk space by using alternative disks
* Installation procedure

* Starting the installation procedure
* Selecting subsets
* Stopping the installation
* Post-installation tasks
* Running the installation verification procedure
* Deleting DECtalk software from your system
* Displaying documentation
* Correcting problems during product installation
* Reporting problems
The runtime software installation procedure installs all files in subdirectories under:
/usr/opt/DTKRT461
The DECtalk Software documentation is provided in PDF, Postscript, and HTML file formats on the distribution CD-ROM. After a successful installation, DECtalk Software online help is accessible in the form of HTML Help and reference (man) pages. For more information, see Displaying Documentation. 
Preinstallation Tasks
This section covers the preinstallation tasks you must perform before installing the DECtalk Software runtime kit. Topics include:
* Accessing the Release Notes
* Registering your software licenses
* Checking the software distribution kit
* Meeting hardware requirements
* Meeting software requirements
* Checking current disk space
* Increasing disk space by using alternative disks
* *  Accessing the Release Notes
DECtalk Software provides release notes containing information about changes to DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX. You should read these release notes before using the product. See the Compact Disc User's Guide shipped with your media for instructions about how to access the release notes prior to the software installation.
The release notes for the DECtalk Software runtime kit are in the following files after the DTKRTRELNOTES461 subset is installed:
/usr/opt/DTKRT461/docs/ascii/release_notes_rt.txt
/usr/opt/DTKRT461/docs/postscript/release_notes_rt.ps
To read the release notes for DECtalk Software use the following command:
# more /usr/opt/DTKRT461/docs/ascii/release_notes_rt.txt
You can also print either file.
 Registering Your Software Licenses
DECtalk Software includes support for the License Management Facility (LMF). You must register your license product authorization keys (License PAKs) in the license database (LDB) to use DECtalk Software on a newly licensed system. The License PAKs are shipped with the kit if you ordered the licenses and media together; otherwise, they are shipped separately to a location specified on your license order.
LMF keys are created by Compaq Computer Corporation. Because of the transition of DECtalk Software from Compaq to Force Computers, Inc., the source of LMF keys may be uncertain temporarily. Contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller or, if you licensed or purchased DECtalk Software directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).
Note
You must have superuser privileges to install the DECtalk Software and to register the license PAK.
If you are installing DECtalk Software as an update on a node already licensed for this software, you have already completed the License PAK registration requirements.
To register a license under the Tru64 UNIX operating system:
1. Log in as root.
2. At the superuser prompt, edit an empty PAK template with the lmf register command as follows, and include all the information on your License PAK:
# lmf register
LMF displays a blank template and invokes an editor to allow you to edit the template. LMF invokes the editor that is defined by your EDITOR environment variable. If the environment variable is undefined, LMF invokes the vi editor.
You must enter the license information from the PAK accurately.
3. When you finish entering the license data, exit from the editor. If the license data is correct, LMF copies it into the license database. If the license data is incorrect, you may reenter the editor and correct mistakes.
Alternatively, you can create a command script enclosing the license information (the license information is in the cover letter with this kit) found between
lmf register - << ENDLMF
and
ENDLMF
Execute this script as root.
4. After you register your license, use the following commands to copy the license details from the license database (LDB) to the kernel cache:
# lmf load 0 DECTALK-SW97-USER
For complete information on using the License Management Facility, see the Guide to Software License Management and the lmf reference page.
 Checking the Software Distribution Kit
Check the contents of your DECtalk Software distribution kit. It should include the following:
* CD-ROM optical disc for systems with optical disc drives
* CD-ROM booklet
If your software distribution kit is damaged or incomplete, contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller or, if you purchased or licensed the product directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).

 Meeting Hardware Requirements
To install DECtalk Software, you need the following:
* Software distribution device (if installing from media)
* A drive for the CD-ROM software distribution media. The CD booklet or the documentation for the CD-ROM drive you are using explains how to load the CD-ROM media.
* A terminal. You can use either a hardcopy or video terminal to communicate with the operating system and respond to the prompts from the installation procedure.
 Meeting Software Requirements
DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX Version 4.61 requires the Tru64 UNIX operating system Version 4.x.  Force also strongly recommends Multimedia Services for Tru64 UNIX V2.x for use with the runtime kit.
 Checking Current Disk Space
To check the current amount of free space for a directory path, log into the system where you will install DECtalk Software. You can check which directories are mounted and their locations by viewing the /etc/fstab file.
For example:
# more /etc/fstab
/dev/rz3a / ufs rw 1 1
/dev/rz3g /usr ufs rw 1 2
/dev/rz3b swap1 ufs sw 0 2
The display indicates that /usr mounted on /dev/rz3g is the only mount point that affects where DECtalk Software files will reside; the system has only one local disk drive, and the /usr/opt file system resides in the g partition of the disk on that drive.
To check the total space and the free space for the directories where DECtalk Software will reside, enter the df command. Given the previous display of the /etc/fstab) file, which shows that only /usr is a mount point, you need to check free space only in the /usr file system. For example:
# df /usr
Filesystem  512-blocks  Used   Avail  Capacity Mounted on
/dev/rz3a   79608       45648  25998  64%      /
/dev/rz3g   1482190     921846 412124 69%      /usr
This display shows that there are 206062 kbytes free on the /usr file system. This free space must accommodate the subsets that you opt to install. If you choose to install all the subsets in the DECtalk Software Runtime kit you will need approximately 11 MB of free disk space. Of this, the unsupported Emacspeak subset uses 2 MB.
 Increasing Disk Space by Using Alternative Disks
The DECtalk Software installation procedure creates and loads files into the subordinate directory:
/usr/opt/DTKRT461
If any of the previously listed directories already exists, the installation procedure uses it.
If you find that there is insufficient disk space for the DECtalk Software subsets and you know that you have additional space on alternative disks or disk partitions for your system, perform the following steps before installing DECtalk Software:
1. Log in as superuser.
2. Create the following directory: 
/usr/opt/DTKRT461
3. Specify in the /etc/fstab file that one or more of the newly created directories are mount points to new disk partitions where there is additional space. 
4. Enter the mount -a command so that the new mount points take effect.

Installation Procedure
This section explains how to install the DECtalk Software runtime kit. Topics include:
* Using the CD-ROM distribution media
* Using an RIS distribution area
* Starting the installation procedure
* Selecting subsets
* Stopping the installation
Installing DECtalk Software takes approximately 5 minutes, depending on your type of media and system configuration.
 * * * *    4. 4. 4. 4.  * * * *  Using the CD-ROM Distribution Media
The following procedure loads DECtalk Software files onto a disk belonging to the system where you perform the installation. When DECtalk Software is run, its executable images are mapped into memory on your system.
To install DECtalk Software from CD-ROM media:
1. Mount the media on the appropriate disk drive.
2. Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install DECtalk Software.
3. Make sure that you are at the root (/) directory by entering the following command:
# cd /
4. Specify the /cdrom directory to be the mount point for the distribution file system on the drive. If your drive is rz4c, enter the following command: 
# mount -dr /dev/rz4c /cdrom
5. Enter a setld command that requests the load function -l and identifies the directory in the mounted file system where DECtalk Software subsets are located. For example, if the directory location for these subsets is /cdrom/4.0/RT/, enter the following command: 
# /usr/sbin/setld -l /cdrom/4.0/RT/ 
6. The installation procedure now displays the names of DECtalk Software runtime kit subsets and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load. 
See Starting the Installation Procedure to continue the installation. 
 Using an RIS Distribution Area
If you are installing DECtalk Software subsets that reside in an /etc/ris RIS distribution area on a remote system, take the following steps:
1. Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install DECtalk Software runtime kit.
2. Make sure that you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following command:
# cd /
3. Enter a setld command that requests the load function (-l) option and identifies the system where the DECtalk Software subsets are located. For example, if you are loading DECtalk Software subsets from a RIS distribution area on node axpmme, enter the following: 
/usr/bin/setld -l axpmme
4. RIS now displays a menu that lists all the software subsets available to you and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load. 
See Starting the Installation Procedure to continue the installation. 
 Starting the Installation Procedure
Before starting the installation procedure:
1. Log in as a superuser and verify that you are at the root directory.  Check to see if there are any previously installed DECtalk Software subsets by entering the following commands:
% su root
# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -i | grep DTK
2. Deinstall any installed subsets with the prefix DTK by entering the following commands: 
# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -d (name of subset)
3. Start the installation procedure by entering the following command: 
# /usr/sbin/setld -l /dev/rmt0h
4. Respond to the installation procedure prompts as described in Selecting Subsets. 
 Selecting Subsets
This section presents a complete installation procedure, including all messages that are displayed on your screen during the installation.
You must specify which DECtalk Software subsets you want to load. If you specify more than one number at the prompt, separate each number with a space, not a comma.
# /usr/sbin/setld -l /cdrom/4.0/RT/
The subsets listed below are optional:
There may be more optional subsets than can be presented on a single
screen. If this is the case, you can choose subsets screen by screen or
all at once on the last screen. All of the choices you make will be 
collected for your confirmation before any subsets are installed.
1) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX CDE Integration.
2) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes.
3) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Runtime Kit.
4) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Documentation.
5) Emacspeak, Speech Enabled Emacs - Sample Program (unsupported).

Or you may choose one of the following options:
6) ALL of the above
7) CANCEL selections and redisplay menus
8) EXIT without installing any subsets

Enter your choices or press RETURN to redisplay menus.
Choices (for example, 1 2 4-6): 6
Next, the script lets you verify your choice. For example, if you enter 6 in response to the previous prompt, you will see the following display:
You are installing the following optional subsets:
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX CDE Integration.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Runtime Kit.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Documentation.
Emacspeak, Speech Enabled Emacs - Sample Program.
Is this correct? (y/n):
If the displayed subsets are not the ones you intended to choose, enter n. In this case, the subset selection menu is displayed again and you can correct your choice of optional subsets. If the displayed subsets are the ones you want to load, enter y. After you respond to this question, the rest of the installation proceeds automatically and all the selected subsets are loaded. A sample of the rest of the installation script is listed below.
Checking file system space required to install selected subsets:
File system space checked OK.

 Stopping the Installation
To stop the installation procedure at any time, press Ctrl/C. Then, interactively delete the files created by the installation up to the point where you stopped the installation. The directories and files created during the DECtalk Software installation are listed in the following file:
/usr/opt/DTKRT461/docs/ascii/filelist.txt
If you encounter any failures during installation, see Reporting Problems.
You may interrupt the installation procedure at any point. However, if you do, the installation may not be left in a useful state. Remove all the subsets you installed and reinstall them.
Post-Installation Tasks
This section explains the post-installation tasks you need to do after the runtime kit installation to make DECtalk Software ready for use. Topics include:
* Running the installation verification procedure
* Deleting DECtalk Software from your system
* Displaying documentation
* Correcting problems during product installation
* Reporting problems
 Running the Installation Verification Procedure
You can run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) during the installation or you can run the IVP independently after installing DECtalk Software to verify that the software is available on your system. You might also want to run the IVP after a system failure to be sure that users can access DECtalk Software.
To run the IVP, enter these commands:
% su root
#/usr/sbin/setld -v DTKRT461
The DECtalk Software IVP verifies the installation as follows:
1. A check for a valid LMF license is made. If no license is found, the IVP fails because the software cannot be tested.
2. DECtalk Software requires that the Multimedia Software for Tru64 UNIX server mmeserver be up and running. If the mmeserver is not already running then the IVP fails. Start the server and try again. To start the server follow the sequence shown below:
% su root
# mmeserver&
 Deleting DECtalk Software from Your System
If you must remove a version of DECtalk Software from your system, delete each subset that you previously installed.
For example to delete a subset, do the following:
1. Log in as superuser login name root, as follows:
% su root
2. Verify that you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following command: 
# cd /
3. Enter the following form of the setld command: 
# setld -i | grep DTK
4. Look for the word "installed" in the listing produced, and then delete the installed subsets. For example: 
# setld -d DTKRT461
# setld -d DTKDEV461
 Displaying Documentation
The DECtalk Software documentation is provided in PDF, Postscript, and HTML file formats on the distribution CD-ROM. You can display the files on your workstation using Adobe Acrobat Reader, a Postscript reader, or a browser application.
After a successful installation, DECtalk Software online help is accessible in two forms:
* Reference (man) pages - Invoke reference page help from the UNIX command line with the man speak command. The DECtalk utility reference pages are installed to the docs/man/man1 subdirectory of the Runtime Kit directory tree.
* HTML Help - Start HTML Help by launching a web browser and loading the online help file defaultdectalk.html. This file can be accessed on the CD-ROM or in the docs/html subdirectory of the Runtime Kit directory tree.
The DECtalk Software HTML Help files include guide and reference information about the following DECtalk features: 
* DECtalk Software applets
* Select DECtalk Software and then the DECtalk Applet Master Index.
* DECtalk Software in-line commands
Select the Reference Guide and then one of the following:
* DECtalk Software In-Line Commands.
* Using In-Line Commands.
 Correcting Problems During Product Installation
If errors occur during the installation, the system displays failure messages. For example, if the installation fails due to insufficient disk space, a message similar to the following is displayed:
There is not enough space for subset SUBSET_NAME
SUBSET_DESCRIPTION (SUBSET_NAME) will not be loaded.
where SUBSET_NAME is the name of the subset and SUBSET_DESCRIPTION is the description of the subset.
For example, DTKRTRELNOT461 is a subset name and DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes V4.61 is a subset description.
Errors can occur during the installation if any of the following conditions exist:
* Operating system version is incorrect.
* Prerequisite software version is incorrect.
* Disk space is insufficient.
* System parameter values for successful installation are insufficient.
For descriptions of error messages generated by these conditions, see the Tru64 UNIX documentation on system messages, recovery procedures, and software installation.

Preinstallation Tasks
This section covers the preinstallation tasks you must perform before installing the DECtalk Software development kit. Topics include:
* Accessing the Release Notes
* Registering your software licenses
* Checking the software distribution kit
* Meeting hardware requirements
* Meeting software requirements
* Checking current disk space
* Increasing disk space by using alternative disks
* * * *  Accessing the Release Notes
DECtalk Software provides release notes containing information about changes to DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX. You should read these release notes before using the product. See the Compact Disc User's Guide shipped with your media for instructions about how to access the release notes prior to the software installation.
The release notes for the DECtalk Software development kit are in the following files after the DTKDEVRELNOTES461 subset is installed:
/usr/opt/DTKDEV461/docs/ascii/release_notes_dev.txt
/usr/opt/DTKDEV461/docs/postscript/release_notes_dev.ps
To read the release notes for DECtalk Software use the following command: 
# more /usr/opt/DTKDEV461/docs/ascii/release_notes_dev.txt
You can also print either file.
 Registering Your Software Licenses
DECtalk Software includes support for the License Management Facility (LMF). You must register your license product authorization keys (License PAKs) in the license database (LDB) in order to use DECtalk Software on a newly licensed system. The License PAKs are shipped with the kit if you ordered the licenses and media together; otherwise, they are shipped separately to a location specified on your license order.
LMF keys are created by Compaq Computer Corporation. Because of the transition of DECtalk Software from Compaq to Force Computers, Inc., the source of LMF keys may be uncertain temporarily. Contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller or, if you licensed or purchased DECtalk Software directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).
Note
You must have superuser privileges to install the DECtalk Software and to register the license PAK.
If you are installing DECtalk Software as an update on a node already licensed for this software, you have already completed the License PAK registration requirements.
To register a license under the Tru64 UNIX operating system:
1. Log in as root.
2. At the superuser prompt, edit an empty PAK template with the lmf register command as follows, and include all the information on your License PAK: 
# lmf register
LMF displays a blank template and invokes an editor to allow you to edit the template. LMF invokes the editor that is defined by your EDITOR environment variable. If the environment variable is undefined, LMF invokes the vi editor.
You must enter the license information from the PAK accurately.
3. When you finish entering the license data, exit from the editor. If the license data is correct, LMF copies it into the license database. If the license data is incorrect, you may reenter the editor and correct mistakes. 
Alternatively, you can create a command script enclosing the license information (the license information is in the cover letter with this kit) found between 
lmf register - << ENDLMF
and
ENDLMF
Execute this script as root.
4. After you register your license, use the following commands to copy the license details from the license database (LDB) to the kernel cache: 
# lmf load 0 DECTALK-SW97-USER
For complete information on using the License Management Facility, see the Guide to Software License Management and the lmf reference page.
 Checking the Software Distribution Kit
Use the bill of materials (BOM) to check the contents of your DECtalk Software distribution kit.
In addition to this guide, the software distribution kit includes the following:
* CD-ROM optical disc for systems with optical disc drives
* CD-ROM booklet
If your software distribution kit is damaged or incomplete, contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller or, if you purchased or licensed the product directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).

Meeting Hardware Requirements
To install DECtalk Software, you need the following:
* A software distribution device (if installing from media)
* A drive for the CD-ROM software distribution media. The CD booklet or the documentation for the CD-ROM drive you are using explains how to load the CD-ROM media.
* A terminal. You can use either a hardcopy or video terminal to communicate with the operating system and respond to the prompts from the installation procedure.
 Meeting Software Requirements
DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX Version 4.61 requires:
* The Tru64 UNIX operating system, Version 4.x.
* The Multimedia Services for Tru64 UNIX Version 2.x.
* The Realtime extension.
* DECtalk Software runtime kit V4.61.
 Checking Current Disk Space
To check the current amount of free space for a directory path, log in to the system where you will install DECtalk Software. You can check which directories are mounted and their locations by viewing the /etc/fstab file. For example:
# more /etc/fstab
/dev/rz3a / ufs rw 1 1
/dev/rz3g /usr ufs rw 1 2
/dev/rz3b swap1 ufs sw 0 2
The display indicates that /usr mounted on /dev/rz3g is the only mount point that affects where DECtalk Software files will reside; the system has only one local disk drive, and the /usr/opt file system resides in the g partition of the disk on that drive.
To check the total space and the free space for the directories where DECtalk Software will reside, enter the df command. Given the previous display of the /etc/fstab file, which shows that only /usr is a mount point, you need to check free space only in the /usr file system. For example:
# df /usr
Filesystem  512-blocks  Used   Avail   Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/rz3a   79608       45648  25998   64%       /
/dev/rz3g   1482190     921846 412124  69%       /usr
This display shows that there are 206062 kbytes free on the /usr file system. This free space must accommodate the subsets that you opt to install. If you choose to install all the subsets in the DECtalk Software development kit you need approximately 2 MB of free disk space.
 Increasing Disk Space by Using Alternative Disks
The DECtalk Software installation procedure creates and loads files into the sub directory:
/usr/opt/DTKDEV461
If any of the previously listed directories already exists, the installation procedure uses it.
If you find that there is insufficient disk space for the DECtalk Software subsets and you know that you have additional space on alternative disks or disk partitions for your system, perform the following steps before installing DECtalk Software:
1. Log in as root
2. Create the directory /usr/opt/DTKDEV461
3. Specify in the /etc/fstab file that one or more of the newly created directories are mount points to new disk partitions where there is additional space.
4. Enter the mount -a command so that the new mount points take effect. 
Installation Procedure 
This section explains how to install the DECtalk Software Development Kit. Topics include:
* Setting up the installation procedure
* Using the CD-ROM distribution media
* Using an RIS distribution area
* Starting the installation procedure
* Selecting subsets
* Stopping the installation
Installing DECtalk Software takes approximately 5 minutes, depending on your type of media and system configuration.
 * *  * * * *   4. 4. 4. 4.  * * * * *  Using the CD-ROM Distribution Media
The following procedure loads DECtalk Software files onto a disk belonging to the system where you perform the installation. When DECtalk Software is run, its executable images are mapped into memory on your system.
To install DECtalk Software from CD-ROM media:
1. Mount the media on the appropriate disk drive. 
2. Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install DECtalk Software. 
3. Make sure that you are at the root (/) directory by entering the following command: 
# cd /
4. Specify the /cdrom directory to be the mount point for the distribution file system on the drive. If your drive is rz4c, enter the following command: 
# mount -dr /dev/rz4c /cdrom
5. Enter a setld command that requests the load function -l and identifies the directory in the mounted file system where DECtalk Software subsets are located. For example, if the directory location for these subsets is /cdrom/4.0/DEV/, enter the following command: 
# /usr/sbin/setld -l /cdrom/4.0/DEV/
6. The installation procedure now displays the names of DECtalk Software subsets and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load. 
See Starting the Installation Procedure to continue the installation. 
 Using an RIS Distribution Area
If you are installing DECtalk Software subsets that reside in an /etc/ris RIS distribution area on a remote system, take the following steps:
1. Log in as superuser login name root to the system where you will install DECtalk Software.
2. Make sure that you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following command: 
# cd /
3. Enter a setld command that requests the load function (-l) option and identifies the system where the DECtalk Software subsets are located. For example, if you are loading DECtalk Software subsets from a RIS distribution area on node axpmme, enter the following: 
/usr/bin/setld -l axpmme
4. RIS now displays a menu that lists all the software subsets available to you and asks you to specify the subsets you want to load. 
See Starting the Installation Procedure to continue the installation.
 Starting the Installation Procedure
Before starting the installation procedure:
1. Log in as a superuser and verify that you are at the root directory.
Check to see if there are any previously installed DECtalk Software subsets by entering the following commands:
% su root
# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -i | grep DTKDEV
2. Deinstall any installed subsets with the prefix DTKDEV by entering the following commands: 
# cd /
# /usr/sbin/setld -d (name of subset)
3. Start the installation procedure by entering the following command: 
# /usr/sbin/setld -l /dev/rmt0h
4. Respond to the installation procedure prompts as described in Selecting Subsets. 
 Selecting Subsets
This section presents a complete installation procedure, including all messages that are displayed on your screen during the installation.
You must specify which DECtalk Software subsets you want to load. If you specify more than one number at the prompt, separate each number with a space, not a comma.
# /usr/sbin/setld -l .
The subsets listed below are optional:
There may be more optional subsets than can be presented on a single
screen. If this is the case, you can choose subsets screen by screen
or all at once on the last screen. All of the choices you make will
be collected for your confirmation before any subsets are installed.
1) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Development Documentation.
2) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Development Kit.
3) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes.
4) DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Sample Programs.

Or you may choose one of the following options:
5) ALL of the above
6) CANCEL selections and redisplay menus
7) EXIT without installing any subsets

Enter your choices or press RETURN to redisplay menus.
Choices (for example, 1 2 4-6): 5
Next, the script lets you verify your choice. For example, if you enter 7 in response to the previous prompt, you will see the following display:
You are installing the following optional subsets:
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Development Documentation.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Development Kit.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes.
DECtalk Software V4.61 for Tru64 UNIX Sample Programs.
Is this correct? (y/n): y
If the displayed subsets are not the ones you intended to choose, enter n. In this case, the subset selection menu is displayed again and you can correct your choice of optional subsets. If the displayed subsets are the ones you want to load, enter y. After you respond to this question, the rest of the installation proceeds automatically and all the selected subsets are loaded. A sample of the rest of the installation script is listed below.
Checking file system space required to install selected subsets:

Post-Installation Tasks
This section explains post-installation tasks you need to do after the development kit installation to make DECtalk Software ready for use. Topics include:
* Running the installation verification procedure
* Deleting DECtalk Software from your system
* Displaying documentation
* Correcting problems during product installation
* Reporting problems
 Running the Installation Verification Procedure
You can run the installation verification procedure (IVP) during the installation or you can run the IVP independently after installing DECtalk Software to verify that the software is available on your system. You might also want to run the IVP after a system failure to be sure that users can access DECtalk Software.
To run the IVP, enter the commands:
% su root
#/usr/sbin/setld -v DTKRT461
The DECtalk Software IVP verifies the installation as follows:
1. A check for a valid LMF license is made. If no license is found, the IVP fails because the software cannot be tested.
2. DECtalk Software requires that the Multimedia Software for Tru64 UNIX server mmeserver be up and running. If the mmeserver is not already running, the IVP fails. Start the server and try again.
To start the server follow the sequence shown below:
% su root
# mmeserver&
 Deleting DECtalk Software from Your System
If you must remove a version of DECtalk Software from your system, delete each subset that you previously installed.
For example to delete a subset, do the following:
1. Log in as superuser login name root, as follows:
% su root
2. Verify you are at the root directory (/) by entering the following command: 
# cd /
3. Enter the following form of the setld command: 
# setld -i | grep DTK
4. Look for the word installed in the listing produced, and then delete the installed subsets. For example: 
# setld -d DTKDEV461
# setld -d DTKDEVDOC461
 Displaying Documentation
The DECtalk Software documentation is provided in PDF, Postscript, and HTML file formats on the distribution CD-ROM. You can display the files on your workstation using Adobe Acrobat Reader, a Postscript reader, or a browser application.
After a successful installation, DECtalk Software online help is accessible in two forms:
* Reference (man) pages - Invoke reference page help for the DECtalk utilities (such as speak) and API functions from the UNIX command line with the man command. The reference pages are installed to the docs/man/man1 subdirectory of the Runtime Kit directory tree and to the docs/man/man3 subdirectory of the Development Kit directory tree.
* HTML Help - Start HTML Help by launching a web browser and loading the online help file defaultdectalk.html on the CD-ROM.  Also, if you installed the DECtalk Software Development Documentation subset (DTKDEVDOCnnn), the online help can be found in the docs/html subdirectory of the Development Kit directory tree.
The DECtalk Software HTML Help files include guide and reference information about the following DECtalk features: 
* DECtalk Software applets
* Select DECtalk Software and then the DECtalk Applet Master Index.
* DECtalk Software API functions
* Select the Programmer's Guide and then the Introduction to the DECtalk Software API. 
* Select the Reference Guide and then DECtalk Software API Functions.
* DECtalk Software in-line commands
Select the Reference Guide and then one of the following:
* DECtalk Software In-Line Commands.
* Using In-Line Commands.
 Correcting Problems During Product Installation
If errors occur during the installation, the system displays failure messages. For example, if the installation fails due to insufficient disk space, a message similar to the following is displayed:
There is not enough space for subset SUBSET_NAME
SUBSET_DESCRIPTION (SUBSET_NAME) will not be loaded.
where SUBSET_NAME is the name of the subset and SUBSET_DESCRIPTION is the description of the subset.
For example, "DTKDEVRELNOT461" is a subset name, and "DECtalk Software for Tru64 UNIX Release Notes V4.61" is a subset description.
Errors can occur during the installation if any of the following conditions exist:
* Operating system version is incorrect.
* Prerequisite software version is incorrect.
* Disk space is insufficient.
* System parameter values for successful installation are insufficient.
For descriptions of error messages generated by these conditions, see the Tru64 UNIX documentation on system messages, recovery procedures, and software installation.
 Reporting Problems
If an error occurs while DECtalk Software is in use and you believe the error is caused by a problem with the product, take one of the following actions:
* If you purchased DECtalk Software from an Authorized Distributor or Reseller, contact your Authorized Distributor or Reseller for support.
* If you purchased or licensed DECtalk Software directly from Force Computers, Inc., contact Force's Field Services Division (FSD), Technical Support, at 408-369-6000 (US) or +49-89-60814-555 (Europe & other non-US).
