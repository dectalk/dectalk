      DEVELOPMENT HINTS FOR DECTALK[R] SOFTWARE
				October 15,2003
   
 DEVELOPMENT HINTS:

1. An application is responsible for NOT SENDING text while the 
   TextToSpeechReset() function is still active.  Appletts defining
   a callback function in TextToSpeech StartUpEx() that contain any
   TextToSpeech...() function calls are likely to cause the DECtalk[R]
   Software to hang.
  
   The callback is implemented mid-way though the TextToSpeechReset()
   function when the DECtalk synthesizer has not finished resetting the
   system.  In addition to hanging, other possible problems include 
   leaving the TextToSpeech...Speaker() and TextToSpeech...Speak() 
   commands waiting for the pipes to finish and the TextToSpeechReset() 
   function waiting for the callback fo finish, e.g. DECtalk Software
   stops speaking.   

   TextToSpeechReset should be called before TextToSpeechCloseInMemory. 
   Failing to do this in a situation where the synthesizer is busy
   may result in a deadlock.

2. When using the in-line [:index mark DD] command, it is not 
   recommended to be used with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI).
   This command was designed for the DIGITAL API (DAPI) only.

3. When linking DECtalk Software DLLs with development environments, 
   other than Microsoft's Visual C ++ V6.0,  you may wish to use the 
   DEF file from our environment, included below.

4. DECtalk ML only registry has changed to eliminate its version dependency:

   Was:
   //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/DECtalk Software/DECtalk/4.62/DefaultLang = "US"
   Now:
   //HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/DECtalk Software/DECtalk/Langs/
   "DefaultLang = "US"

   note: Multi-Language (ML) is currently supported under Windows CE

5. Creating a release kit with your DECtalk SDK.

   Key: Where {lang} is "US", "UK", "SP", "LA", "GR", or "FR".
		Quotes are NOT part of the value.
	Where {langname} is the language name for a specific language:
	{lang}	{langname}
	US		"ENGLISH, US"
	SP		"SPANISH"
	LA		"LATIN AMERICAN"
	GR		"GERMAN"
	UK		"ENGLISH, UK"
	FR		"FRENCH"
		Quotes are NOT part of the value.
	Where {version} is "5.00" or current version number.
	Where {appname} is the name of an application using DECtalk,
	Where {licpswd} is encrypted password for licenseu.exe program.
	Where {liccount} is encrypted no. of authorized engine licenses.
	Where {clsidno} is the CLSID numbers for a specific {lang}.
	{lang}		{clsidno}
	"US"		"{ED737300-8FCB-11ce-AB5D-00AA00590F2B}"
	"SP"		"{99EE9560-A4A6-11d1-BEB2-0060083E8376}"
	"LA"		"{99EE9550-A4A6-11d1-BEB2-0060083E8376}"
	"GR"		"{99EE9570-A4A6-11d1-BEB2-0060083E8376}"
	"UK"		"{99EE9540-A4A6-11d1-BEB2-0060083E8376}"
		You MUST include the {} around the clsidno specified.
		Quotes are NOT part of value.

   This section will cover the necessary points for making an
   installable kit that uses the DECtalk components.

   The required DECtalk files:
   (These must be included in your distributed kits)

   a) DTALK_{lang}.DLL  (and msvcrt.dll) [dapi products] 
      OR 
      DTLKTTSE_{lang}.DLL (and speech.dll) [sapi products] 

   b) DTALK_{lang}.DIC  (dictionary file) 
      ie. DTALK_US.DIC, DTALK_UK.DIC, DTALK_SP.DIC, DTALK_LA.DIC, DTALK_GR.DIC and DTALK_FR.DIC

   And any files that are necessary for your application. 
   This includes your USER_{lang}.DIC file 
   (this is an optional file - DECtalk will still run 
   without USER_{lang}.DIC). 

   The DLL files must be installed in the following directory: 
	  windows\system  (Win95\98\ME) 
      winnt\system32  (NT\WIN2000) 
      windows\        (Win CE, Note: SAPI is not currently supported) 

   Also note that the DIC file must be located in the same
   directory as your application if it is located in a
   different place than noted in the registry entry
   (see below for more details).

   The following registry entries MUST be set:
  
   For SAPI supported products(French not supported):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{clsidno}
   "DECtalk_{lang}"="DECtalk TTS Engine {lang}"

   * Not for French 
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{clsidno}\InprocServer32
   @="C:\WIN95\Speech\dtlkttse_{lang}.dll"

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Software\DECtalk Software\DECtalk\{version}
   "Version"="DECtalk MultLang version {version}
   "Language"="MULTI LANGUAGE"

   For SAPI products (MicroSoft standard keys):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\{appname}.exe
   "Path"="C:\Program Files\DECtalk\;C:\Program Files\DECtalk\Help"
   @="C:\Program Files\DECtalk\{appname}.exe"

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\DECtalkDeinstKey
   "UninstallString"="C:\WIN95\uninst.exe -f\"C:\Program Files\DECtalk\DeIsL6.isu\""
   "DisplayName"="DECtalk V{version}"

   * Not for french
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Voice\TextToSpeech\Engine
   "DECtalk_{lang}"="{clsidno}"

   * Not for french
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{CB96B400-C743-11cd-80E5-00AA003E4B50}
   @ = "Audio Destination Object"
   
   * Not for french
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{CB96B400-C743-11cd-80E5-00AA003E4B50}\InprocServer32
   @ = "C:\WINNT\Speech\speech.dll" *
   "ThreadingModel" = "Apartment"

   For DAPI and SAPI supported products:

   LICENSING:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\DECtalk Software\DECtalk\{version}
   "Company"="q"
   "Installer"="q"
   "LicUpdPwd"="{licpswd}"
   "Lock_MGR"="2"
   "Licenses"="{liccount}"
   "MultiLang"="1"

   MAIN DICTIONARY:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\DECtalk Software\DECtalk\{version}\{lang}
   "Version"="DECtalk {lang} version {version}"
   "Language"="{langname}"
   "MainDict"="C:\Program Files\DECtalk\{lang}\DTALK_{lang}.DIC"

   USER DICTIONARY:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DECtalk Software\DECtalk\{version}\{lang}
   "UserDict"="C:\Program Files\DECtalk\{lang}\USER_{lang}.DIC"


   MULTI-LANGUAGE:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\DECtalk Software\DECtalk\Langs
   "US"="ENGLISH, US"
   "DefaultLang"="UK"
   "SP"="SPANISH"
   "LA"="LATIN AMERICAN"
   "GR"="GERMAN"
   "UK"="ENGLISH, UK"
   "FR"="FRENCH"
